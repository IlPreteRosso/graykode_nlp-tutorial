## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you to everyone who contributes. Here are some rules to follow before contributing.
1. Contributions are open to the smallest details such as typos, comments and code refactors.
2. Do not commit the jupyter notebook file(*.ipynb). When the modified python code is merged into the master branch, the github action automatically generates an ipynb.
3. Please attach a commit message appropriate to the modified code.
